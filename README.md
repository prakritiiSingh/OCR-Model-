# OCR-Model-
This project takes scanned documents or images as input, runs OCR to extract text and layout, and feeds the extracted content into a document-understanding model (for example, a LayoutLM-based or transformer-based model) to perform tasks such as key-value extraction, classification, or table parsing.
